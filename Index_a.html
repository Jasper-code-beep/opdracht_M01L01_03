            <h2>The Sun</h2>
              <p>The sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. 
             Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. 
             Without the sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. 
             And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy. 
             If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, the Earth would be the size of a U.S. nickel. 
             The temperature at the sun's core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

              <p>The regular daily and monthly rhythms of Earth&#39s only natural satellite, the Moon, have guided timekeepers for thousands of years. 
              Its influence on Earth&#39s cycles, notably tides, has been charted by many cultures in many ages.</p>
